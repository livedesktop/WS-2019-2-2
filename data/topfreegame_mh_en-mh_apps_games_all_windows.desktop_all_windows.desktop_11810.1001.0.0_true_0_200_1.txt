You can casually play 4-5 levels a day for when you're in a bus or in a line. But if you are more competitive, you can set your goals much higher. You can even compete with people around the world and be the first to complete all 10,000 levels. You can check the online leaderboards after each level you complete to see where you stand in the world.\r\nIt might start easy at first. Anyone might be able to win the first 10 levels. But those are just for warm up. As you progress the levels will become extremely challenging. Then, to progress further, you will have to rethink your choices more than once. Ready for this epic challenge? Start playing now!\r\n\r\n\r\n*** Why should I play ***\r\n\r\n★ Easy to play: Just tap on the pairs that add up to 13\r\n★ Levels are short and relaxing. Also good for 1 minute breaks. \r\n★ 10,000 winnable levels that guarantee you thousands of hours of relaxing fun;\r\n★ Advanced Hint option and Undo to help you make even better choices along the way;\r\n★ 4 different card styles to fit your preferences and for better seeing;\r\n★ 5 background styles;\r\n★ Natural animations, beautiful graphics and a very intuitive interface;\r\n★ For the more avid players, take notice: Even if you play 10 minutes a day, you will still need 3+ years to complete all levels ;) . \r\n\r\n\r\n*** How to play ***\r\n\r\n- The goal of the game is to clear as many boards as possible by tapping any two cards that add up to exactly 13. For example, you can tap a 10 and a 3, or an 8 and a 5. Aces count as 1, Jacks count as 11, Queens count as 12 and Kings count as 13.\r\n- You can tap away the king with just one move. To eliminate a queen, you need to match it with an ace.\r\n- You can match any uncovered card. \r\n- If there are no more available matches, press \"Draw\" to draw cards from the deck below. You can draw the entire stack three times over. \r\n\r\n\r\n♥♥ Support and Feedback\r\nIf you have any technical problems, please email us directly at support@gsoftteam.com.

They will learn about finding patterns and picking up simple differences.   The game emphasizes positive reinforcement and can be directed to show labels for the objects (which may be particularly useful to people learning English as a second language).\r\n\r\nThis game has two modes: Easier where four pictures of similar objects are displayed and three of them are identical and a Harder mode where the four pictures are all different but one is unlike the others.  All of the puzzles have a pool of images to draw from, so repeat play will produce randomly different variations on the puzzles.  The order in which the objects are displayed is also random.  In testing this application with 2- and 3-year olds, we found it was necessary to provide a random element to the game to prevent memorization of the correct answers.\r\n\r\nThe game keeps track of a simple scorecard and will continuously loop through the puzzles.  This allows young children to stay engaged with the learning experience instead of requiring assistance to start and stop.   The game also features an optional background soundtrack and sound effects to emphasize positive and negative outcomes.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDC64W","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Mafia: Street Fight","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.19469.9007199266352404.798a76fe-bae0-4350-a595-a44932fba112.356ea95f-6296-47ec-ad63-5e2df00d4445","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.49285.9007199266352404.3b3b800f-6d2d-4915-bed3-943f0b67e47b.75d9919c-560e-4077-9074-06eb2fe9cf87","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.63180.9007199266352404.0cc57f67-2e07-4d75-af86-60da9355b880.858c5ed4-40dc-4b37-ae58-7fe825b570d8","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.31869.9007199266352404.6a614cb5-8c91-4f69-a1fe-306aae0a9841.5e6d4175-3ac5-4af8-a50c-f628d112611d","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["49423SergeyDev.MafiaStreetFight_r0q6p19v53z0g"],"ContentIds":["d535193c-3c33-4221-f671-2eed91accddb","d7d67b31-b7e3-6270-4263-39b5939a2b8b"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"In the 30 years during the Great Depression in the United States formed a large number of war between mafia families which is gradually heated up.\r\nIn this game you will plunge into the atmosphere of the time and present themselves in the form of a mafia gangster, who will defend their territory against hostile groups.\r\nAt that time only began to appear affordable and reliable cars and became very popular among the warring mafia groups.\r\n\r\nThe player goes to the car and fired off from the mafia that has plagued him, the main task of the player to kill as many opponents without touching civilians and not to attract the attention of police.

As any other successful game, millions of clones have been created on all possible platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We tried to recreate all the fun of original game in a tiny download package. \r\n\r\nThe object is to take at least the number of tricks that were bid before play of the hand began. The bids and tricks taken are combined for a partnership. Spades is a descendant of the Whist family of card games, which also includes Bridge, Hearts, and Oh, Hell. Its major difference as compared to other Whist variants is that, instead of trump being decided by the highest bidder or at random, the Spade suit is always trump, hence the name. \r\n\r\nA standard pack of 52 cards is used ranked from highest to lowest: \r\nA, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2. \r\nThe four players are in fixed partnerships, with partners sitting opposite each other. The first dealer is chosen at random, and the turn to deal rotates clockwise. The cards are shuffled and dealt clockwise. \r\nAll four players bid a number of tricks. Each team adds together the bids - number of tricks that team must try to win in order to get a positive score. Everyone must bid a number. Players are not allowed to pass and bids once made cannot be altered. A bid of 0 tricks is known as Nil. This is a declaration that that the player who bid Nil will not win any tricks during the play. There is an extra bonus for this if it succeeds and a penalty if it fails. The partnership also has the objective of winning the number of tricks bid by the Nil's partner. \r\n\r\nThe player to dealer's left leads any card (except a spade). Each player, in turn, clockwise, must follow suit if able; if unable to follow suit, the player may play any card. \r\nA trick containing a spade is won by the highest spade played; if no spade is played, the trick is won by the highest card of the suit led. The winner of each trick leads to the next. Spades may not be led until either some player has played a spade, or the leader has nothing but spades left in hand. \r\nA side that takes at least as many tricks as its bid calls for receives a score equal to 10 times its bid. Additional tricks (bags) are worth an extra one point each. A side which (over several deals) accumulates 10 or more bags has 100 points deducted from its score. Any bags beyond 10 are carried over to the next cycle. If a side does not make its bid, they lose 10 points for each trick they bid. If a bid of nil is successful, the nil bidder's side receives 100 points addition to the score won (or lost) by the partner of the nil bidder for tricks made. If a bid of nil fails - that is, the bidder takes at least one trick - the bidder's side loses 100 points, but still receives any amount scored for the partner's bid. \r\nThe usual rule is that when a nil fails, the tricks won by the nil bidder do not count towards making the partner's bid, but do count as bags for the team. The side which reaches 500 points first wins the game.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDLZ05","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Solitaire - Klondike","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.63197.9007199266438766.168fa032-51d7-4ecc-b78a-59bf6df0c3e3.b2f9df49-fab6-4b1b-a04f-3030a8d1821b","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.8554.9007199266438766.2f67ebbd-1354-4ac0-85c4-599c7ccfee75.89d18597-7b46-499b-9f9a-7a951b9cf576","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["GASPMobileGamesInc.Solitaire-Klondike_9haz0p453120e"],"ContentIds":["41304f8a-8554-715b-7497-8e852ea5c16e","ce7bd466-b05c-01b5-e979-f74126105605"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Back in 1990s inclusion of Solitaire, Minesweeper in Windows has resulted in billions of hours of lost productivity over the years.

A drift is when a driver performs a controlled slide through corners while adhering to the racing line. Drifting involves fast cars, super skilled drivers and hardcore fans.\r\n\r\nIt’s a combination of driving skill, style and showmanship. It’s all about loss of the rear wheel traction while keeping the race car in total control. Drifting is so popular because it brings all the best aspects of motor sports into one package. Highly skilled drivers control a high powered street car past its limit, sideways at high speed, burning rubber. It can’t get any better!\r\n____________________________________\r\n\r\nSUPPORT: http://en.ratrodstudio.com/support/ \r\nVISIT US: http://ratrodstudio.com\r\nFOLLOW US: twitter.com/ratrodstudio","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFJCQG","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Hills Of Glory 3D Free","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.53671.9007199266251289.13535c4d-6a88-4b44-ad5a-744418aa5497.76a8540e-f956-44fa-b1fc-37e51de1aa52","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.3981.9007199266251289.31ed733c-a592-46dc-a5d3-9fff9bc8ecf6.d37f9e01-29f9-4c53-8e91-75ee90476618","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.31417.9007199266251289.e4ab6ac6-5087-4d98-9184-009f7da8c10b.ea397d85-4117-4078-ad67-b757282a8c33","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.53263.9007199266251289.ce59f13c-9f9e-4307-96cb-5d81dd8b5071.ca2401a9-3fa7-4b46-8383-b2b740b9d125","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.58899.9007199266251289.88368e3c-069a-47a4-9970-febea38372c6.a5e8ea0f-d78f-4594-8321-f1e2097dbe9a","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.1977.9007199266251289.633e7547-fe54-471f-8c4b-936aa9574c0c.7517056a-eb75-4501-9a6c-b0e7f74530be","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["AdvancedMobileApplication.HillsOfGlory3DFree_e8bwa11sm2b6c"],"ContentIds":["a75e6e4b-4212-ffb3-39c0-17c20e352d0e"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"ALL NEW: Celebrate the 70th anniversary of the WWII with the Free Europe update.

10!\r\n\r\nSolitaire remains the most played computer game of all time, and for good reason. Simple rules and straightforward gameplay make it easy to pick up for everyone.\r\n\r\nSolitaire has been part of Windows for more than 25 years, and the Microsoft Solitaire Collection makes it the best experience to date with five different card games in one:\r\n\r\nKlondike\r\nThis version is the timeless classic that many people just call \"Solitaire.\" Try to clear all the cards from the table using one or three-card draw, while using traditional scoring or the Vegas scoring system.\r\n\r\nSpider\r\nEight columns of cards await your attempts to clear them with the fewest moves possible. Start out playing with a single suit until you’re comfortable, and then see how you fare when using two or even all four suits in a game.\r\n\r\nFreeCell\r\nUse four extra cells to move cards around as you try to clear all cards from the table. More strategic than the Klondike version, FreeCell rewards players who think several moves ahead.\r\n\r\nTriPeaks\r\nSelect cards in a sequence, either up or down, to earn points and clear the board. How many boards can you clear before you run out of deals?\r\n\r\nPyramid\r\nPair two cards that add up to 13 in order to remove them from the board. Try to reach the top of the pyramid. See how many boards you can clear and how high you can score in this highly addictive card game!\r\n\r\nDaily Challenges\r\nPlayers receive new challenges each day.
