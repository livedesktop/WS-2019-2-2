Spending money on different objects that we simply don't need is definitely not a smart thing to do. However, sales could be also very useful. We wish to have certain object or we really need it but its price is simply too high. In that case we wait for the sale and get them on reasonable price.\r\n\r\nMartha and Lori work as shop assistants in one small shopping center. Traditionally, every year, they organize sales that has been very famous in the city where they live. It is something like a holiday because the sale always offers rather decreased prices so everyone could afford to buy the object that he/she always wanted. People even decide not to go to work on this day and dedicate the whole day on shopping. That way they will save some money and allow themselves different modern objects and clothes.\r\n\r\nEven though this day is a really wonderful and noble day, Martha and Lori know that this will be a rather difficult day for them, with a lot of hard work.

Non stop Gin Rummy fun is finally here.\r\n\r\nGin Rummy is a two player card game created by Elwood. T. Baker and his son Graham Baker. Gin Rummy evolved from 19th century Whiskey poker and created with the intention of being faster than standard rummy but less spontaneous than knock Rummy. \r\n\r\nThe objective of Gin Rummy is to score points and reach an agreed number of points or more, usually 150 before the opponent does. The basic game strategy of Gin Rummy is to improve one's hand by forming melds and eliminating deadwood. Gin Rummy has two types of melds: Sets of 3 or 4 cards sharing the same rank, and runs of 3 or more cards in sequence, of the same suit. Deadwood cards are those not in any melds. Aces are considered low, they can form a set with another aces but only the low end of runs. A Gin Rummy player can form any combination of melds within their hand, whether it contains all the sets, all runs, or both. A hand can contain three or fewer melds to knock or form legal Gin. \r\n\r\nDeveloped specifically for the the Phone and Tablet with an intuitive interface, Gin Rummy will be a pleasure to play and pass time anywhere, anytime. And guess what? Gin Rummy is FREE! \r\n\r\nBored sitting at home or the subway?

Choose between different opponents, each with a different playing style, select one who matches your skill level and try to earn the most points. Sort your cards to form sets and runs, keep an eye on your opponent and use the right strategy to win! Are you able to get a Gin?\r\n\r\nIt's a method generally known as \"draw and discard\", because at each turn you draw one or more cards from a stockpile and throw out an unwanted card in exchange. Your aim in doing this is to form your hand into sets of matching cards, or melds. \r\n\r\nToday, Gin Rummy is one of the most popular forms of Rummy. As with all games in the Rummy family, you must try to arrange your cards into sets and sequences and lay them down as quickly as possible. \r\n\r\nThe aim of the game for the two players is to get groups of the same values or sequences in the same suits to be able to knock. You should pay attention to what cards you lay and which ones your opponent selects. The player with the lower value after laying wins the round. The winner of the entire game is the player who reaches the agreed number of points first.\r\n\r\nCard games are a big part of life. Whether you’re young, old, or middle-aged, you’ve probably played some card games in your life. The thing with card games is that you might love them, or you might absolutely hate them. But you have to respect them due to the amount of skill it takes to become proficient in any type of card game. So Gin Rummy is obviously here to stay.\r\n\r\nThe basic game strategy of Gin Rummy is to improve one's hand by forming melds and eliminating deadwood. \r\n\r\nIt is probably the greatest of the traditional rummy games, and one of the best traditional card game for two players. The game is great because of its relatively long hand time, it's incredibly high skill ceiling, and its low skill floor.\r\n\r\nGin Rummy, you can only master, appreciate and enjoy the game well when you start playing the game. It's worth a shot, and may be worth a place in your catalog of lifestyle games.\r\n\r\nDownload Gin Rummy today for endless hours of fun!!!\r\n\r\n◆◆◆◆ Gin Rummy Features◆◆◆◆\r\n\r\n✔ Lucky Draw -

impermanence of life. It is a reflection on transience, a balancing act between progress and regrowth, a reminder to find beauty in decay and inevitable destruction. Using old-school “shmup” mechanics and forms, [FE] invites the player to explore a world of quick actions, forced decisions, and subtle strategy: but with each decision, the player falls ever out of balance. \r\n\r\nAs balance decays so does the world, eroding over time and out of space, binding the player to a smaller area, pressing in upon the mind. Built upon multi-layered interactions, a Wabi Sabi aesthetic idealism, and a rich, broken world of yesterday’s fantasies, [FE] asks the player to reflect upon their play, their world, their nostalgia, and themselves. \r\n\r\nFind your balance, live a life well played.\r\n\r\nFragile Equilibrium plays out using classic side-scrolling shmup mechanics across four levels descending into chaos. As your skills improve there are four levels of difficulty ranging from easy to insane. Local high score in the classic style will allow you and your friends to compete for the highest score!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9N7VCNJXND05","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"The World Of One","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.23927.14057276012267442.4850d6ca-360d-45d0-9ee1-b5899489ff17.a4a1e297-d6c6-4100-9db9-ffc71557ec1f","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.4499.14057276012267442.4850d6ca-360d-45d0-9ee1-b5899489ff17.60029103-0efe-437a-b3ac-8d36fd975ea4","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.27875.14057276012267442.4850d6ca-360d-45d0-9ee1-b5899489ff17.3f41324f-30e7-402f-82de-4d8df4c966fb","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.7115.14057276012267442.4850d6ca-360d-45d0-9ee1-b5899489ff17.01b07c83-8760-4fcd-bb78-fd9ef0dc688a","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"AU$4.45","Price":4.45,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["53E4EFE6.WorldOfOneUWP_153j13zhvfy8w"],"ContentIds":["9e2eb025-9e23-57ce-8a61-4f409a1443dd","07348945-087a-4b8d-7aed-570016d6976c"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Xbox One","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"\"Imagine...\r\nYou live in your own small world that has everything you need – cozy home, backyard with a rocking chair, beautiful garden, and your own amusement park with music and unlimited amounts of fireworks to launch.

and consuming other players to gain mass to grow the largest and longest in the game. Once the player starts the game and is spawned into the virtual world, their avatar cannot stop moving forward. If the player's worm's head collides into a part of another worm, the player will die. The defeated avatar's body turns into bright, shining pellets for other players to consume. As much pellets as it takes for the equivalent amount of mass as the worm had exactly before its death will be transmuted. These pellets that remain from \"death\" of an avatar will correspond to the color of the avatar itself, and are both brighter and bigger than \"normal\" pellets, which spawn naturally throughout the world. Normal pellets do not give as much mass as pellets dropped from other worms. \"Chase\" pellets will appear individually in various places of the world, and when eaten, give a greater amount of mass than pellets dropped by other worms. Chase pellets avoid worms and flee when they draw near. Chase pellets can be obtained by boosting.\r\n\r\nBy pressing and holding the space bar or left/right mouse button (on mobile, double-tapping the touchscreen), the player can use their boost, which causes the avatar to speed up. When the button (or, on mobile, the finger on the touchscreen) is released, the worm will stop using its boost. When a player uses their boost, the worm loses some mass, causing the worm's size to shrink slightly, with the mass that is lost from the boost appearing as a line of small pellets where the boost was used. The mass lost can be regained by consuming the pellets. Similar to pellets dropped from defeated avatars, the boost pellets correspond to the color of the avatar. The boost feature is useful to outmaneuver and defeat opponents.[4] A common strategy that is used by players to defeat opponents is of the player's avatar coiling around the opponent's in a loop, until the opponent, trapped in the loop, crashes into the player.\r\n\r\nThere is a border that confines avatars within the circular game board. If a worm hits the border, the player automatically dies without turning into the aforementioned pellets. As of now it is removed, in 2016, the player with the biggest worm at the end of the day was able to share a \"victory message\" with the world. On each server, leaderboards are displayed at the top right, showing the top ten players with worms that have the most mass out of all the other worms in the entire server.\r\n\r\nDownload all your favorites: diep io (diep.io), Zombs Royale (zombsroyale.io), Agario (agar.io), Slitherio (slither.io), Paper.io (paper.io) and tons more directly our Windows Store!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9N25S7KGVB58","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Yahtzy Dice","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.57098.13962554804302865.57ebca36-4eba-40f1-bcd3-7132b3fef71c.3e5d1d41-9643-45a5-89c1-6037517ba033","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.17100.13962554804302865.57ebca36-4eba-40f1-bcd3-7132b3fef71c.ab07f4d5-90c5-431c-85a4-39e3be5800b0","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["AlgoTech.YahtzyDice_gv5wzkkne8ctg"],"ContentIds":["840bdf90-eec5-89a4-7376-2155d5244576","d657ad31-b835-f8d2-fe67-9f1f5fe8719e"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Yahtzy is a game from Yacht family of dice games such as Yahtzee, Yatzy, Generala.

Porcupine works the night shift in a warehouse. Each night he gets instructions about where the crates should go. Then he just has to push them into place. Sounds easy, right?\r\n\r\nThe style of the puzzles in Pepe Porcupine originates from a Japanese game called Sokoban. Sokoban means warehouse keeper in Japanese ((倉庫番 sōkoban).  Sokoban is a type of transport puzzle, in which the player pushes boxes or crates around in a warehouse, trying to get them to storage locations. The game is played on a board of squares, where each square is a floor or a wall. Some floor squares contain boxes, and some floor squares are marked as storage locations. \r\n\r\nThe player is confined to the board, and may move horizontally or vertically onto empty squares (never through walls or boxes). The player can also move into a box, which pushes it into the square beyond. Boxes may not be pushed into other boxes or walls, and they cannot be pulled. The puzzle is solved when all boxes are at storage locations. \r\n\r\nWe are thrilled to have created such a nice version of this game!

She has passed a long way just to get to the crystal tree. If you are wondering why exactly that tree, hear this reason. Namely, Lori's sister is very sick for a longer period of time. She has tried numerous medications that were promising a relief from her sickness, but none of these gave a positive result. That's why Lori decided to go as far as she needs just to get to the crystal tree. Actually Lori believes that someone has made an evil magic to her sister. She has heard that the most helpful objects can be found around that crystal tree and only those objects could save her sister. This tree seems like the only hope for the sister so Lori will do everything needed for her sister to feel better.\r\n\r\nLet's help the two sisters bring their lives to normal by helping Lori collect all the magical objects.

The game is safe for all ages but comes without all the distractions that games for kids usually have. Anyone with a taste for puzzle and mind games should give A Game of Lines and Nodes a try. The game does not require any special permissions in your device, works offline and has no ads.\r\n\r\nThe game involves playing with lines and dots (we call them nodes) but is far from being a simple connect-the-dots game. A Game of Lines and Nodes combines elements of Hashi or Hashiwokakero (橋をかけろ, literally translated to “build bridges!”), plus some features that make it unique, engaging and relaxing.\r\n\r\nThe game is somewhat similar to Hashi in that the nodes have a required number of connections and in that lines cannot jump over nodes or other lines. However, nodes here are 'floating' and can be dragged around freely. Also, there can only be one connection between the same two nodes, unlike Hashi where there can be up to two.\r\n\r\nAs the nodes get connected, polygons and figures takes form, helping you to determine if you are in the right track to solve the puzzle. Just watching nodes react to each other as they are dragged around contributes to the relaxed environment and is quite entertaining.\r\n\r\nThere are no timers in this game, or any other element or mechanic that will make you feel rushed or under pressure. You can take as long as you like to complete a level, you can even save the state of a puzzle and complete it in more than one play sessions.\r\n\r\nA Game of Lines and Nodes is designed to be as hard or as easy as you want it to be. You can test your might by playing a level without any help and you may succeed, specially after you are more experienced. However, help is always available if you choose to use it.\r\n\r\nThere are no ads, no subscriptions and no in-app purchases. Also, the game is safe for all ages and  the simple interface and controls will appeal to both young and mature audiences.\r\n\r\nThe game can be played in English, Spanish or Chinese (中文) and the language can be changed at any time from the Welcome screen. \r\n\r\nFEATURES\r\n\r\n  • Easy to learn and play but challenging\r\n  • Relaxed no-rush environment\r\n  • No ads, no subscriptions, and no in-app purchases\r\n  • No internet connection needed to play\r\n  • Does not require special permissions in your device\r\n  • Safe for all ages\r\n  • Clean and minimalist user interface\r\n  •
