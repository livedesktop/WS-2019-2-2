They will learn about finding patterns and picking up simple differences.   The game emphasizes positive reinforcement and can be directed to show labels for the objects (which may be particularly useful to people learning English as a second language).\r\n\r\nThis game has two modes: Easier where four pictures of similar objects are displayed and three of them are identical and a Harder mode where the four pictures are all different but one is unlike the others.  All of the puzzles have a pool of images to draw from, so repeat play will produce randomly different variations on the puzzles.  The order in which the objects are displayed is also random.  In testing this application with 2- and 3-year olds, we found it was necessary to provide a random element to the game to prevent memorization of the correct answers.\r\n\r\nThe game keeps track of a simple scorecard and will continuously loop through the puzzles.  This allows young children to stay engaged with the learning experience instead of requiring assistance to start and stop.   The game also features an optional background soundtrack and sound effects to emphasize positive and negative outcomes.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDC319","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"Shouting goats","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.21797.9007199266355228.e050dbb1-75c3-4c82-b59b-7d60532c323a.e644d416-3a6b-45c4-b810-021652e4c90e","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["46936PatrickKalkman.Shoutinggoats_tdfbqdb29wqy4"],"ContentIds":["08fb2bec-6aa9-85d0-a49f-621deba174bd"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Create a sing along session with goats.

Sometimes very simple rules generate patterns of astonishing complexity. The patterns are generated on a two-dimensional lattice of cells. Each cell can be in one of two states: alive (on) or dead (off). A transition between the states is influenced by the cell’s neighbourhood – the eight cells surrounding the one in question.\r\n\r\nInitially, the lattice is populated randomly with alive and dead cells. After starting the simulation, the cells evolve by reproducing, dying, or surviving according to the user-defined rules. These rules are applied simultaneously to all the cells on the lattice. But there is also an option to apply the rules randomly, and doing so can sometimes generate quite unusual patterns.\r\n\r\nThe WBS Cellular Automata app is able to visualize smooth transitions between the alive and dead state. These transitional stages are represented by the shades of the two user-defined colors.\r\n\r\nThere is also an option of drawing the initial state of the automaton field with a mouse or, on touch devices, with your fingers. The field can be cleared first by clicking the Clear Field button in the bottom app bar.\r\n","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDG2BN","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"Simple Cube Timer","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.52208.9007199266304543.4218646a-7de9-4084-b9ed-acfa1b6ff5c1.6fb77fa6-3a55-4590-8e9d-f216d8652bfa","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000055","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["47668Nunkromancer.SimpleCubeTimer_xyxagan527y6j"],"ContentIds":["7088b70c-1f3b-4cd1-93e3-780bb4b6d2e3"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"This app is a simply-designed Rubik's Cube solve timer for speedcubers.

As any other successful game, millions of clones have been created on all possible platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We tried to recreate all the fun of original game in a tiny download package. \r\n\r\nThe object is to take at least the number of tricks that were bid before play of the hand began. The bids and tricks taken are combined for a partnership. Spades is a descendant of the Whist family of card games, which also includes Bridge, Hearts, and Oh, Hell. Its major difference as compared to other Whist variants is that, instead of trump being decided by the highest bidder or at random, the Spade suit is always trump, hence the name. \r\n\r\nA standard pack of 52 cards is used ranked from highest to lowest: \r\nA, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2. \r\nThe four players are in fixed partnerships, with partners sitting opposite each other. The first dealer is chosen at random, and the turn to deal rotates clockwise. The cards are shuffled and dealt clockwise. \r\nAll four players bid a number of tricks. Each team adds together the bids - number of tricks that team must try to win in order to get a positive score. Everyone must bid a number. Players are not allowed to pass and bids once made cannot be altered. A bid of 0 tricks is known as Nil. This is a declaration that that the player who bid Nil will not win any tricks during the play. There is an extra bonus for this if it succeeds and a penalty if it fails. The partnership also has the objective of winning the number of tricks bid by the Nil's partner. \r\n\r\nThe player to dealer's left leads any card (except a spade). Each player, in turn, clockwise, must follow suit if able; if unable to follow suit, the player may play any card. \r\nA trick containing a spade is won by the highest spade played; if no spade is played, the trick is won by the highest card of the suit led. The winner of each trick leads to the next. Spades may not be led until either some player has played a spade, or the leader has nothing but spades left in hand. \r\nA side that takes at least as many tricks as its bid calls for receives a score equal to 10 times its bid. Additional tricks (bags) are worth an extra one point each. A side which (over several deals) accumulates 10 or more bags has 100 points deducted from its score. Any bags beyond 10 are carried over to the next cycle. If a side does not make its bid, they lose 10 points for each trick they bid. If a bid of nil is successful, the nil bidder's side receives 100 points addition to the score won (or lost) by the partner of the nil bidder for tricks made. If a bid of nil fails - that is, the bidder takes at least one trick - the bidder's side loses 100 points, but still receives any amount scored for the partner's bid. \r\nThe usual rule is that when a nil fails, the tricks won by the nil bidder do not count towards making the partner's bid, but do count as bags for the team. The side which reaches 500 points first wins the game.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDLZ05","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Solitaire - Klondike","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.63197.9007199266438766.168fa032-51d7-4ecc-b78a-59bf6df0c3e3.b2f9df49-fab6-4b1b-a04f-3030a8d1821b","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.8554.9007199266438766.2f67ebbd-1354-4ac0-85c4-599c7ccfee75.89d18597-7b46-499b-9f9a-7a951b9cf576","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["GASPMobileGamesInc.Solitaire-Klondike_9haz0p453120e"],"ContentIds":["41304f8a-8554-715b-7497-8e852ea5c16e","ce7bd466-b05c-01b5-e979-f74126105605"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Back in 1990s inclusion of Solitaire, Minesweeper in Windows has resulted in billions of hours of lost productivity over the years.

A drift is when a driver performs a controlled slide through corners while adhering to the racing line. Drifting involves fast cars, super skilled drivers and hardcore fans.\r\n\r\nIt’s a combination of driving skill, style and showmanship. It’s all about loss of the rear wheel traction while keeping the race car in total control. Drifting is so popular because it brings all the best aspects of motor sports into one package. Highly skilled drivers control a high powered street car past its limit, sideways at high speed, burning rubber. It can’t get any better!\r\n____________________________________\r\n\r\nSUPPORT: http://en.ratrodstudio.com/support/ \r\nVISIT US: http://ratrodstudio.com\r\nFOLLOW US:

Edit. Share. Smile. The free Adobe Photoshop Express app provides photo magic at your fingertips. \r\n\r\nJoin millions of creative folks who trust and use Adobe Photoshop Express for fast, powerful, and easy editing. This is the one-stop shop for your quick and fabulous photo editing needs.\r\n\r\nUse Adobe Photoshop Express to create better looking pictures. Use slide bar adjustments or automatic one-touch fixes to achieve great results. If you’re new to the app, here are few ways to improve your photos:\r\n\r\nINTRODUCING NEW LOOKS AND BORDERS:\r\n\r\nCREATIVE LOOKS:\r\n\r\n* Now choose from more than 45 eye-catching effects called Looks! Control the intensity of Looks with a simple slider. Different categories of Looks like Black and White, Portrait, Nature, Pop Color, and Duo Tones help to get you the right effect to apply.\r\nBORDERS:\r\n\r\n* Use our newly added Borders to add a distinctive personal touch to your photos with 30+ borders and frames. Express yourself!\r\nEDIT PHOTOS:\r\n\r\n* Quickly open photos from the device.\r\n* Snap pictures from right within the app.\r\n* Edit photos to their possible best. An easy to use interface provides seamless switching between various edits.\r\n* The comprehensive photo editor allows you to polish your photos so that you can turn your imagination to reality.\r\n\r\nCROP:\r\n\r\n* Fix photos fast — crop, straighten, rotate clockwise and anticlockwise, flip horizontal and vertical.\r\n\r\n* Crop also provides easy one-touch default aspect ratios.\r\n\r\nCORRECTIONS:\r\n\r\nMake your photos pop with simple sliders:\r\n\r\n* Control and set contrast, clarity, saturation, vibrance, dehaze\r\nUse these controls in your photos to produce stunning results. \r\nContrast is an attention-grabbing control that can turn your ordinary photo into a dazzling masterpiece.\r\nAdjust the color saturation using the Vibrance and Saturation controls.\r\nAdjust clarity slider to reveal more texture and detail in your photos.\r\nUse the Dehaze slider to add or remove haze from your photo.\r\n\r\n* Exposure, highlights, shadows, blacks and whites\r\nYou can fine-tune the photo’s exposure setting using the Exposure adjustment controls. Highlights and Shadows are the best way to optimize your photo’s exposure in highlights, midtones, and shadows, without compromising on other areas of tonality.\r\nUse Blacks and Whites to set black point and white point of the photo. This makes colors appear completely black or white.\r\n\r\n* Temperature and Tint\r\nUse Temperature and Tint controls to introduce warmth or coldness to your photo. You can also control the amount of green and red tones in your photo.\r\nUse the Temperature slider controls to increase or decrease the amount of orange or blue tone. Increasing the amount of orange introduces warmth to your photo. Increasing the amount of blue introduces coldness to your photo.\r\nUse the Tint slider control to add more red or green tone to your photo. Auto White-Balance does this automatically for you.\r\n\r\n* Details\r\nUse Sharpen, Reduce Luminance Noise, and Reduce Color Noise to make photos look more beautiful and minimize unwanted grain and speckling in your photos.\r\n\r\n* Split Tone\r\nStylize your photos through color tints in the highlights and shadows.\r\n\r\n* Blur\r\nUse the Blur effect to give your images an enhanced, surreal effect.\r\n\r\n* Fade\r\nBlend images with the background using the new “Fade” effect and give a matte feel to your photos.\r\n\r\n*Vignette Effect\r\nAdd a sentimental feeling or evoke nostalgia to your images using the Vignette effect.\r\n\r\nSPOT HEAL\r\n* Removing spots or blemishes have never been so easy! Remove pimples, scars, dirt and dust from your photos with one touch.\r\n\r\nREMOVE RED EYE AND FIX PET EYE:\r\n\r\n* Just a tap is required to remove red-eye of people or pets in photos.\r\nYou can use the Red Eye tool to reduce the red eyes in the subjects of your photo. This desaturates the red pixels within the target area and reduces the effect.\r\n\r\nAUTO FIX: \r\n\r\n* Edit your photos with a one-touch auto adjustment.\r\n\r\nRAW PHOTO SUPPORT:\r\n*Photoshop Express supports the following file formats:\r\n• Photo: JPG, PNG\r\n• Raw files: arw (SONY), cr2 (CANON), crw (CANON), dng, erf (EPSON), raf (FUJI), 3fr and fff (HASSELBLAD), dcr (KODAK), mrw (KONICA), mos (LEAF), rwl (LEICA), nef and nrw (NIKON), orf (OLYMPUS), rw2 (PANASONIC), pef (PENTAX), srw (SAMSUNG.\r\nPRINT FEATURE: \r\n* Print the edited photos directly using your Windows device.\r\nSTORE AND SHARE:\r\n\r\n* Your original photo is not lost during editing.
